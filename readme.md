## Overview
This repository documents my journey toward earning the **Associate Data Scientist** certification from DataCamp, as part of my B.Tech in Computer Science with AI. The certification validates foundational skills in data analysis, statistical experimentation, and communication using Python. Here, you’ll find code, projects, and notes from key courses and the final practical exam, organized into subfolders.

- **Start Date**: March 23, 2025  
- **Target Completion**: April 20, 2025  
- **Goal**: Build job-ready skills for Data Scientist or ML Engineer roles (targeting ₹10-15 LPA post-graduation).  

## Certification Structure
The Associate Data Scientist certification consists of:  
1. **DS101**: Python coding and basic statistics.  
2. **DS102**: Statistical experimentation (e.g., A/B testing).  
3. **Practical Exam**: Real-world data analysis project with a presentation.  

Preparation is being completed via the *Data Scientist with Python* career track on DataCamp, focusing on Python, data manipulation, machine learning basics, statistics, and visualization.

## Repository Structure
Each subfolder contains Python scripts (`.py`), Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`), datasets, and notes from the respective course or skill area. Below is the breakdown:
