## Overview
This repository documents my journey toward earning the **Associate Data Scientist** certification from DataCamp, as part of my B.Tech in Computer Science with AI. The certification validates foundational skills in data analysis, statistical experimentation, and communication using Python. Here, you’ll find code, projects, and notes from key courses and the final practical exam, organized into subfolders.

## Certification Structure
The Associate Data Scientist certification consists of:  
1. **DS101**: Python coding and basic statistics.  
2. **DS102**: Statistical experimentation (e.g., A/B testing).  
3. **Practical Exam**: Real-world data analysis project with a presentation.  

Preparation is being completed via the *Data Scientist with Python* career track on DataCamp, focusing on Python, data manipulation, machine learning basics, statistics, and visualization.

## Repository Structure
Each subfolder contains Python scripts (`.py`), Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`), datasets, and notes from the respective course or skill area. Below is the breakdown:

### Subfolder Details
1. **01_Python-Basics**:  
   - Focus: Core Python skills from *Intermediate Python*—completed March 23, 2025.  
   - Tools: Python 3.x.  

2. **02_Data-Manipulation**:  
   - Focus: Data wrangling with *Data Manipulation with Pandas*.  
   - Tools: Pandas, NumPy.  

3. **03_Machine-Learning-Basics**:  
   - Focus: Intro to ML with *Supervised Learning with scikit-learn* and *Unsupervised Learning*.  
   - Tools: scikit-learn, Python.  

4. **04_Statistics**:  
   - Focus: Foundational stats from *Introduction to Statistics*.  
   - Tools: Python, statistical libraries.  

5. **05_Data-Visualization**:  
   - Focus: Plotting insights with *Data Visualization with Matplotlib*.  
   - Tools: Matplotlib, Seaborn (optional).  

6. **06_Practical-Exam**:  
   - Focus: Final project—data analysis and presentation (e.g., sales trends, customer behavior).  
   - Tools: Python, Pandas, scikit-learn, Matplotlib.  

## How to Use This Repo
- **Explore**: Check subfolders for code and notes on specific skills.  
- **Run**: Open `.ipynb` files in Jupyter Notebook or Colab—dependencies are standard (Python 3.x, Pandas, scikit-learn, Matplotlib).  
- **Learn**: Each `README.md` in subfolders summarizes key takeaways.
